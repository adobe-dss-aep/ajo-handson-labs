## Lab - Create a Collection in Adobe Journey Optimizer

In this exercise, you will create a Collection in Adobe Journey Optimizer.
collections are group of offers that are used to make a decision on which offers to propose in a specific context. 
Here we want to create a collection of all our investment offers.  

1.  Navigate to Offers in the Left Menu
2.  Select Collections
3.  Click “Create Collection”

4.  Enter a Name for the Collection:  use the following naming convention :  "FSI - investment offer XX” where XX is your attendee number. Ex “FSI - investment offer 01”

5.  Select “Create Dynamic Collection”
By selecting dynamic collection, we ensure that all future offers containing a specific tag will automatically be included in the collection. 

6.  Click Next

7.  Select the "FSI - investment offer XX" tag you just created. Add also the existing FSI - investment offer” Tag to include previously created offers.  Notice that the previous offer created with the “FSI - investment offer” tag is added to the collection. We don't yet have any offers with your "FSI - investment offer XX" tag yet, but it will be automatically added once created.

8.  Click Save
