## Lab - Create a Collection in Adobe Journey Optimizer

In this exercise, you will create a Collection in Adobe Journey Optimizer.
collections are group of offers that are used to make a decision on which offers to propose in a specific context. 
Here we want to create a collection of all our coupon offers.  

1.  Navigate to Offers in the Left Menu
2.  Select Collections
3.  Click “Create Collection”

4.  Create a Name for the Collection:  Example – “Luma Coupon Offer XXX” where XXX is your attendee number. Ex “Luma Coupon Offer 001”

5.  Select “Create Dynamic Collection”
By selecting dynamic collection, we ensure that all future offers containing a specific tag will automatically be included in the collection. 

6.  Click Next
