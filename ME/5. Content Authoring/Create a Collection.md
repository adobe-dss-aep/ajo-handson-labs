## Lab - Create a Collection in Adobe Journey Optimizer

In this exercise, you will create a Collection in Adobe Journey Optimizer.
collections are group of offers that are used to make a decision on which offers to propose in a specific context. 
Here we want to create a collection of all our coupon offers.  

1.  Navigate to Offers in the Left Menu
2.  Select Collections
3.  Click “Create Collection”
![Collection](https://github.com/adobe-dss-aep/ajo-handson-labs/blob/e78540bf14699c2fc98ab7eba157d8216335ee2b/0.%20Images/Collection_1.png)

4.  Enter a Name for the Collection:  use the following naming convention :  "Media Premium Trial Offers XX” where XX is your attendee number. Ex “Media Premium Trial Offers 01”

5.  Select “Create Dynamic Collection”
By selecting dynamic collection, we ensure that all future offers containing a specific tag will automatically be included in the collection. 

6.  Click Next

7.  Select the "Media Premium Trial Offers XX" you just created. Add also the existing “Media Premium Trials XX” Tag to include previously created offers.  Notice that the previous offer created with the “Media Premium Trials XX” tag is added to the collection. We don't yet have any offers with your "Media Premium Trials 001" tag, but it will be automatically added once created.

8.  Click Save
